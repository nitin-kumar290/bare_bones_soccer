        Release of Liability:
        
        I, for myself, my heirs, personal representatives, or assigns, do hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant not to sue Bare Bones Soccer Collective LLC, its officers, employees, agents, affiliates, sponsors, volunteers, and all other businesses, venues, locations, or entities used by Bare Bones Soccer Collective LLC (collectively, the "Released Parties"), including but not limited to any fields, facilities, or establishments where events, games, practices, or related activities take place, whether on or off the premises of Bare Bones Soccer Collective LLC, including any third-party partners, hosts, or event locations. This release applies to any and all liability, claims, demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by me, or to any property belonging to me, whether caused by the negligence of the Released Parties or otherwise, while participating in the soccer games or in any activities related to the soccer games during the year 2025.
        
        Assumption of Risk:
        
        I am fully aware of the risks involved and hazards connected with participating in the soccer games, including but not limited to physical injury, death, and property damage. I hereby elect to voluntarily participate in the soccer games, knowing that the activity may be hazardous to me and my property. I voluntarily assume full responsibility for any risks of loss, property damage, or personal injury, including death, that may be sustained by me as a result of being engaged in such activities, whether caused by the negligence of the Released Parties or otherwise.
        
        Indemnification:
        
        I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Released Parties from any loss, liability, damage, or costs, including court costs and attorney fees, that they may incur due to my participation in the soccer games, whether caused by the negligence of the Released Parties or otherwise.
        
        I agree that I am at least 18 years old.
        
        Medical Treatment:
        
        I hereby consent to receive medical treatment that may be deemed advisable in the event of injury, accident, and/or illness during the soccer games.
